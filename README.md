pretty-lights
=============

Pretty Lights is a cross between a screensaver and an art project.

Usage
=====

Use any old webserver to serve the project directory. On my Windows machine I use:

java fi.iki.elonen.SimpleWebServer --dir C:/pretty-lights

Then click on parts of the webpage. Try clicking more than once on the same spot. Note: double clicks, dragging, etc, don't do anything.

Try It
======

Temporarily, you can try it directly from my dropbox account:
